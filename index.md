## The Programming Experience
As a programmer, I am always looking to learn and get through challenges that I ~~may~~ will face. **Although programming is full of challenges and _not everything is easily accomplished_ , I see that as a growth.**   
Ultimately, new things can be an enjoyable experience because it is a new experience and getting the hang of it makes new learning experiences worthwhile.  
I feel it is very important to ***communicate*** with others in order to have clear expectations of one another. As it:  
>Would be awful to have merging issues.  
Such as, ff there was one 'git push' that caused things to go boom. 

## My Ultimate Interest
One things my friends know about me is when I talk about BMWs too much, and they are right.  
I am always on the [BMW](https://www.bmwusa.com/build-your-own.html#/series) website configuring a BMW I can't afford but dream of buying to replace my [BMW](myvehicle.md).
