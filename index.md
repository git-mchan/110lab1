# **Matthew Chanthirat**
My name is _Matthew Chanthirat_. I am a programmer who is always looking to learn and get through challenges that I ~~may~~ will face. **I am aware that programming is full of challenges and _not everything is easily accomplished_ which is fine and part of growing.** 
I feel it is very important to ***communicate*** with others in order to have clear expectations of one another. As it:

If there was one 'git push' that caused things to go boom. 
## My Interest
One things my friends know about me is when I talk about BMWs too much, and they are right.
I am always on the [BMW](https://www.bmwusa.com/build-your-own.html#/series) website configuring a BMW I can't afford but dream of buying to replace my BMW. 
I find challenges interesting, for example when looking at [this](README.md) assignment, it is a learning process for me but I think I am getting the hang of it which makes it enjoyable.
